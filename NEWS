What is Wireshark?

   Wireshark is the world's most popular network protocol
   analyzer. It is used for troubleshooting, analysis, development
   and education.

What's New

  Bug Fixes

   The following bugs have been fixed:
     * Redirecting the standard output didn't redirect the output
       the of -D or -L flags. This fix means that the output of
       those flags now goes to the standard output, not the
       standard error, as it did in previous releases. [1]Bug 8609

  New and Updated Features

   The following features are new (or have been significantly
   updated) since version 1.8:
     * Wireshark on 32- and 64-bit Windows supports automatic
       updates.
     * The packet bytes view is faster.
     * You can now display a list of resolved host names in
       "hosts" format within Wireshark.
     * The wireless toolbar has been updated.
     * Wireshark on Linux does a better job of detecting interface
       addition and removal.
     * It is now possible to compare two fields in a display
       filter (for example: udp.srcport != udp.dstport). The two
       fields must be of the same type for this to work.
     * The Windows installers ship with WinPcap 4.1.3, which
       supports Windows 8.
     * USB type and product name support has been improved.
     * All Bluetooth profiles and protocols are now supported.
     * Wireshark now calculates HTTP response times and presents
       the result in a new field in the HTTP response. Links from
       the request's frame to the response's frame and vice-versa
       are also added.
     * The main welcome screen and status bar now display file
       sizes using strict SI prefixes instead of old-style binary
       prefixes.
     * Capinfos now prints human-readable statistics with SI
       suffixes by default.
     * It is now possible to open a referenced packet (such as the
       matched request or response packet) in a new window.
     * Tshark can now display only the hex/ascii packet data
       without requiring that the packet summary and/or packet
       details are also displayed. If you want the old behavior,
       use -Px instead of just -x.
     * Wireshark can be compiled using GTK+ 3.
     * The Wireshark application icon, capture toolbar icons, and
       other icons have been updated.
     * Tshark's filtering and multi-pass analysis have been
       reworked for consistency and in order to support dependent
       frame calculations during reassembly. See the man page
       descriptions for -2, -R, and -Y.
     * Tshark's -G fields2 and -G fields3 options have been
       eliminated. The -G fields option now includes the 2 extra
       fields that -G fields3 previously provided, and the blurb
       information has been relegated to the last column since in
       many cases it is blank anyway.
     * Wireshark dropped the left-handed settings from the
       preferences. This is still configurable via the GTK
       settings (add "gtk-scrolled-window-placement = top-right"
       in the config file, which might be called [/.gtkrc-2.0 or
       ]/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini).
     * Wireshark now ships with two global configuration files:
       Bluetooth, which contains coloring rules for Bluetooth and
       Classic, which contains the old-style coloring rules.
     * The LOAD() metric in the IO-graph now shows the load in IO
       units instead of thousands of IO units.

Getting Wireshark

   Wireshark source code and installation packages are available
   from [2]http://www.wireshark.org/download.html.

  Vendor-supplied Packages

   Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark
   packages. You can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using
   the package management system specific to that platform. A list
   of third-party packages can be found on the [3]download page on
   the Wireshark web site.
     __________________________________________________________

File Locations

   Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for
   preference files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries.
   These locations vary from platform to platform. You can use
   About->Folders to find the default locations on your system.
