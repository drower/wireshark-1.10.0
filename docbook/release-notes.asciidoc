== What is Wireshark?

Wireshark is the world's most popular network protocol analyzer. It is
used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.

== What's New

=== Bug Fixes

The following bugs have been fixed:

//* ws-buglink:5000[]
//* ws-buglink:6000[Wireshark bug]
//* cve-idlink:2013-2486[]
//* Wireshark will practice the jazz flute for hours on end when you're trying to sleep. ws-buglink:0000[]
* Redirecting the standard output didn't redirect the output the of -D or -L
flags. This fix means that the output of those flags now goes to the
standard output, not the standard error, as it did in previous releases. ws-buglink:8609[]

=== New and Updated Features

The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
since version 1.8:

* Wireshark on 32- and 64-bit Windows supports automatic updates.
* The packet bytes view is faster.
* You can now display a list of resolved host names in "hosts" format
within Wireshark.
* The wireless toolbar has been updated.
* Wireshark on Linux does a better job of detecting interface addition
and removal.
* It is now possible to compare two fields in a display filter (for
example: udp.srcport != udp.dstport). The two fields must be of the same
type for this to work.
* The Windows installers ship with WinPcap 4.1.3, which supports Windows 8.
* USB type and product name support has been improved.
* All Bluetooth profiles and protocols are now supported.
* Wireshark now calculates HTTP response times and presents the result in a new
field in the HTTP response. Links from the request's frame to the response's
frame and vice-versa are also added.
* The main welcome screen and status bar now display file sizes using
strict SI prefixes instead of old-style binary prefixes.
* Capinfos now prints human-readable statistics with SI suffixes by
default.
* It is now possible to open a referenced packet (such as the matched request or
response packet) in a new window.
* Tshark can now display only the hex/ascii packet data
without requiring that the packet summary and/or packet details are also
displayed.  If you want the old behavior, use -Px instead of just -x.
* Wireshark can be compiled using GTK+ 3.
* The Wireshark application icon, capture toolbar icons, and other icons
have been updated.
* Tshark's filtering and multi-pass analysis have been reworked for consistency
and in order to support dependent frame calculations during reassembly. See the
man page descriptions for -2, -R, and -Y.
* Tshark's -G fields2 and -G fields3 options have been eliminated.  The
-G fields option now includes the 2 extra fields that -G fields3 previously
provided, and the blurb information has been relegated to the last column since
in many cases it is blank anyway.
* Wireshark dropped the left-handed settings from the preferences. This is
still configurable via the GTK settings (add
"gtk-scrolled-window-placement = top-right" in the config file, which might be
called ~/.gtkrc-2.0 or ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini).
* Wireshark now ships with two global configuration files: Bluetooth, which
contains coloring rules for Bluetooth and Classic, which contains the old-style
coloring rules.
* The LOAD() metric in the IO-graph now shows the load in IO units instead 
of thousands of IO units.

== Getting Wireshark

Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
http://www.wireshark.org/download.html.

=== Vendor-supplied Packages

Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages. You can
usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management system
specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can be found
on the http://www.wireshark.org/download.html#thirdparty[download page]
on the Wireshark web site.

== File Locations

Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for preference
files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These locations vary
from platform to platform. You can use Aboutâ†’Folders to find the default
locations on your system.
